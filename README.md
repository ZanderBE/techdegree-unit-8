# Techdegree Project 8: Build a Public API to create a Gallery

## Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below:

- Use at least 1 of the supplied APIs from the Project Resources section.
	•	Make sure to use endpoints that do not require an API key or the use of OAuth for this project.

- Or an API you have chosen yourself.
- Grab at least 6 items from the API.
	•	For example 6 movies from Open Movie Database, 6 Albums from Spotify.
	
- Display these 6+ total items in an attractive gallery
	•	See the api-thumbnail-page.png mockup file. You don't need to use photos if the API doesn't provide them. Clickable item titles work as well. Or you can use regular photos (not photos retrieved from the API) as thumbnails.
	•	Click a thumbnail to open a lightbox with displaying details of the item:
	•	Name/title
	•	Description
	•	Image
	•	Other relevant data such as date, categories, price
